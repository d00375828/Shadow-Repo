##  HIG Implementation

Each screen uses a clear hierarchy, logical grouping, and familiar navigation patterns to help users understand the appâ€™s flow without needing instructions. Buttons and controls use rounded corners, consistent padding, and high-contrast colors to indicate interactivity while maintaining accessibility and readability. The theming emphasizes simplicity and legibility, ensuring that important information stands out without clutter or distraction.

Feedback and motion were also implemented following HIG principles. Button presses and toggles provide visual responses to confirm interaction, and modals slide naturally into view. The bottom tab navigation mimics native iOS apps, making it easy for users to move between the Record, Insights, Training, and Settings screens. Overall, Shadow applies HIG concepts to deliver a focused, comfortable, and professional interface that feels native on all platforms.
